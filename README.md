## About

SmartifyOS is a base application (source code) that makes it easy for you to create a custom GUI for a DIY infotainment system in older cars. It is based on the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/), which means you have almost unlimited possibilities to customize it to your liking. SmartifyOS has a lot of GUI Unity Editor tools that make it easy for you to use even if you don't have a lot programming experience!

[More details](https://smartify-os.com/about)

### This repo contains:
1. The SmartifyOS base application with all the editor tools
2. The full software for my Miata build on-top of the SmartifyOS base application (can be removed for clean start)

### Project structure:
All scripts you can use as a base to make your own system are in `Assets/SmartifyOS` all other folders in `Assets` (mainly `Scripts` and `ScriptableObjects`) are using the code from `Assets/SmartifyOS` as a base and are specific for my car and setup (like Arduinos and sensors). To remove the example project you can simply click `SmartifyOS > Create Blank Project` and select what you want to remove.

I also tried to make everything in `Assets/SmartifyOS` so that you shouldn't need to modify anything in it to work with your specific setup since all the project specific code is in `Scripts` and `ScriptableObjects`.

Since SmartifyOS is still in the development phase there will probably be cases where you need to modify smoothing in `Assets/SmartifyOS`. Then just keep in mind that anything in there should not be (too) project (car/setup) specific.
